* What type of project can I enter?
Basically any program you'll have completed by the deadline.

- From a class :: for a class - for example, a capstone class, a web
  development class, a software engineering class or any other class
  where you've created a significant project

- For a hackathon :: If you built something for a hackathon, you can
  reuse it for Pitchfest. This would be a perfect opportunity for you
  to get feedback on what you built.

- A personal project :: If you've been working on a portfolio project,
  Pitchfest is a perfect chance to get some feedback and practice
  presenting it to the world.
  
* Do I need a team to enter?

Individual and team projects can be entered with the caveat that the
event space has a limited capacity. If we exceed capacity, priority
will be given to group projects.

* What about the video?

The video should be short and just has to show the basic functionality
of your project. It does not require sound and it does not have to
show every feature. It's just so that we know that your project runs
prior to Pitchfest.

It shouldn't be more than a minute or two.

* Tell me more about the demo/presentation?

Pitchfest is an informal event. It's an opportunity for you to build
your network, practice pitching, and get feedback on both your project
and your presentation.

The pitch isn't a formal pitch. Think of it like a class presentation
or a hackathon presentation.

You should be able to demo/pitch your project in under 5 minutes. At
Pitchfest you will be presenting multiple times to different tech
professionals.
